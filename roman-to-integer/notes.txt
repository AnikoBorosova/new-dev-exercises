don't use string for parameter - better use something else, not an existing js keyword

better use the default branch in switch statement for errors handling, to throw error in case we get something else

instead of array.shift() better to increment the index - not good practise to modify the array as we iterate through it, 
it could lead to unexpected errors

Instead of switch statement we can use an object for mapping the roman numbers to integers and not use an array, 
but go through the object keys

From others:
use "throw new Error()" in default case inside switch statement
use try catch when calling the keyToValue function, and return -1 when catching an error

------ TO TRY TO CODE IT ------
efficient:
object for mapping
current, next variables

if (current < next)
to not modify the array or increment
